# EEG-Alzheimers-Classification

This project analyzes resting state-closed eye EEG recordings and participant data to explore potential biomarkers for Alzheimerâ€™s disease. It extracts brainwave activity in key frequency bands from raw EEG signals and combines these neural features with demographic and cognitive test data for classification

Accuracy: 78%

The workflow is implemented in Python using the MNE-Python library and follows a reproducible, notebook-based approach.
